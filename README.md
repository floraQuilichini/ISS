# ISS


This code uses PCL.1.8.1 functions to compute the ISS detector on a point mesh (see https://www.researchgate.net/publication/224135303_Intrinsic_shape_signatures_A_shape_descriptor_for_3D_object_recognition). <br />
It takes as input the filename of the mesh, the resolution of the mesh (ie mean edge length if mesh or mean distance to neighbors if point cloud), and the output filename where to write the selected keypoints. <br />
